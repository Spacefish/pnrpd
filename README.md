# pnrpd
Platform independent PNRP Daemon implementing the PNRP Protocol for distributed name resolution

# Description
This is my first attempt to hack some daemon in C for linux. I never wrote a lot of C code before so please excuse my bad style..
i will try to implement Microsofts PNRP protocol (Peer Name Resolution Protocol) so we can have a daemon which runs on IoT devices / small embeeded system which are later on discoverable by their peername from some other machine, like a smartphone or PC.
